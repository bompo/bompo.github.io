Hi Frog! is the first big game from Die Kapitäne Media GmbH. I joined the team when the game was being in development for roughly a year. As this was our first mobile game we had a lot of challenges to solve. First, we had to establish a good Team structure (code reviews, build server and so on). 

Also, we didn't know at that time what the terms "retention" and "cohort" meant. That is why we developed a few times in the "wrong" direction. 
Nevertheless, the game was well-received and downloaded over a million times.
