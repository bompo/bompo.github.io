> "Webchemy" - Serendipitous Sketching, Now on Android

Me and [bitbof](http://bitbof.com/ "bitbof") recently released his sketching application "Webchemy" to the&nbsp;Android&nbsp;Play Store.

Webchemy is a drawing app for creating idea sparking sketches. In a matter of minutes or sometimes seconds, you'll have an interesting sketch that can serve as the starting point for more elaborate artworks. Or you can just play around indefinitely, for the fun of it, as there is a lot of that to go around!
