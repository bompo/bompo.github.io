Update 2:
Here is the [source code](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39448/gdx/bullet_gdx_src.zip) for the JNI bullet engine in libgdx. Only the lib for android is included, so it won't run on desktop (compile the bullet lib if you need it).

Update:
I tried the c++ version of bullet over jni from [here](http://www.noritsuna.com/archives/2009/08/bullet_for_andr.html). This leads to an speed increase of around 10 times. For complex scenes this still doesn't seem enough.
You can try the Apk on your device [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39448/gdx/Bullet_Gdx_Android.apk).

At the moment libgdx only supports Box2D as a physics engine. So I tried [JBullet](http://jbullet.advel.cz/) and [jinngine](http://code.google.com/p/jinngine/) to test the performance of 3D physics engines.

Sadly the performance of both physic engines isn't good on android. JBullet is too slow and with jinngine dalviks garbage collector goes nuts. But anyway, here are some screenshots and the jars.

JBullet: Milestone: ~1 FPS


Ragdoll example in jinngine: Milestone: ~10 FPS

After&nbsp;realizing&nbsp;that the tested 3D physics engines are too slow for android devices I tried Box2D (which is buildin in libgdx) in a 3D environment. Box2D seems to run fast enough (around 5ms/frame with 100 cubes) to be used in a real game. I will try that in the future...

Milestone: ~15fps at start and ~40fps if anything has settled
