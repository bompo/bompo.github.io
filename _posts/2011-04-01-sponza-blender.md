The Atrium Sponza Palace running in realtime in the Blender Game Engine. GLSL "HDR" Shader from martinsh (<blenderartists.org/ forum/ showthread.php?t=156482>)

I also playing around with some WebGL Frameworks for my student thesis.&nbsp;This is the Sponza model from&nbsp;[Crytek](http://www.crytek.com/cryengine/cryengine3/downloads)&nbsp;in&nbsp;[XML3D](http://www.xml3d.org/). I used the Blender Exporter from XML3D which exported fine besides the textures.&nbsp;It forget to add the wrap tags to the textures which i added manual.

See it&nbsp;[here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39448/opengl_prak/xml3d/sponza.xhtml). (beware, file is 32MB big and you will need a WebGL capable browser)&nbsp;
