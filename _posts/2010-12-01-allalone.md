I started working on an artsy horror survival game. The game is about being lost in a dark forest. You have to reach the safe house and avoid the bear who tries to track you. Other friendly animals will show you the path to the safe house or warn you if the bear approaches. There will be no weapons, items or even a gui. Just you and the dark forest. I try to make this as minimalistic and immersive as possible.
