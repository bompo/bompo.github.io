CS:AR is a AR game developed in Unity. We used ARKit and ARCore as base frameworks. The game consists of various minigames like identify fingerprints or search for clues on virtual and real objects. The biggest challenge in the game were the different real environments the player can be in. There had to be enough space to place all hidden objects for instance. The AR tracking also needs a environment with enough contrast to be stable.
