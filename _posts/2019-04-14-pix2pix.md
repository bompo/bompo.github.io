Different kind of training for CR7 to use him as a virtual avatar with Pix2Pix (using the code of [datitran](https://github.com/datitran/face2face-demo)).

I generated the dataset from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_vjWX8tawQ). The Network is trained with OpenCV landmark images from a source video. The same landmark detection is applied to the webcam output.
