> Guide the sphere to the exit. Only a block can stop it once the sphere moves. So use the blocks wisely to reach the exit. But it won't be as easy as that! Portals, switches and even movable blocks will challenge your brain. The game features 24 mind-bending levels along with local highscores and a time attack mode. Create your own levels with the ingame editor. Enjoy the 3d graphics and a soundtrack written by [bitbof](http://bitbof.com/).
