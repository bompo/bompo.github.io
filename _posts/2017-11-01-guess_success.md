Guess Success is our first Facebook Instant Game. This is Facebooks game plattform for his messenger. Its different from most quiz games as you only have to guess the answer instead of choosing from a set of answers. The game supports 1v1 vs facebook friends or random people.

We had to shift from Unity to a HTML5 game engine as Unity wasn't supported at the time of development. I choosed the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) language with [haxe flixel](http://haxeflixel.com/) as Framework for this game. The backend and multiplayer game logic is written in Firebase.
