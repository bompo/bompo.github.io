We have developed a Product Scanner which can detect cosmetic products with the help of Machine Learning. This means the user does not have to search for a barcode. And often cosmetic products no longer have a barcode on the product itself.

By scanning the products, the user collects stars which can be exchanged for vouchers or cosmetic products.
