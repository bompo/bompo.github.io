> ReBounce! is simple: Shoot the ball into the goal! Sounds too easy? Then challenge your friends or impress players around the world with your trick shots!
> It's an exciting physics puzzle game with a strong multiplayer functionality. Connect with your friends over Facebook and play against them in quick and easy matches. Send them challenges and watch them fail in replays!

This is a casual game with a simple mechanic. We added an asynchronous multiplayer mode to this game. You don't play in real-time against your opponents.  Rather, your matches are recorded and used later. This is great for slow 3G devices as there is no constant internet connection needed.
