I made a new live wallpaper based on the effect from&nbsp;http://depthy.me/

Note: This only works with images of the official Google Camera Application in combination with the Lens Blur Feature

How To:
- open the Google Camera Application
- shoot an image with the Lens Blur image
- long press on a free spot in your home screen
- select Wallpaper
- select Lens Blur Live Wallpaper
- go to settings and choose the Lens Blur image

**Download**
